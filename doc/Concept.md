| **Name** | **Characteristics** | **Bentefits** | **Minuses** |
|---|---|---|---|
| minikube | Supported by OS and Architecture: Linux, MacOS and Windows, architecture depends on the platform. Automation: Minicube can be automated with scripts and other software. The presence of additional functions: Minico does not have built -in additional functions, but supports Kubernetes standard functions, such as monitoring and cluster monitoring. | Easy to use and set up. Local testing and development on one computer. Many operating systems, including Windows, MacOS and Linux., support the automatic deployment of applications on Kubernetes cluster. | Limited the possibility of scaling compared to the real Kubernetes cluster. Requires additional setup to integrate with Docker. |
| kind | Supported OS & arch: Linux, MacOS and Windows, architecture depends on the platform. Automation: Kind can be automated with scripts and other software. The following features: Kind allows you to create Kubernetes clusters in Docker Containers, and has additional features for testing and deployideployment clusters. | Fast and easy to use. Local testing and development on one computer. Many operating systems, including Windows, MacOS and Linux., support the automatic deployment of applications on Kubernetes cluster. | Limited the possibility of scaling compared to the real Kubernetes cluster. Docker problems may occur, especially with licensing. | 
| k3d | K3D (Kubernetes in 3 Dimensions) is a tool for creating local Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers using Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE). Some of its characteristics: supported OS: Linux, MacOS and Windows. Supported Architecture: X86 and ARM Automation: Yes, the ability to create and configure clusters using Cli additional fun. Ease of use: simple and intuitive interface speed of deployment: rapid creation and removal of clusters stability of work: stability depends on the environment in which it is used | Fast and easy to use. Local testing and development on one computer. Many operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. can automatically deploy applications on Kubernetes cluster. Supporting additional features such as Kubernetes monitoring and control of Kubernetes. | Cluster size restrictions: K3D may be limited in the size of a cluster that can be deployed as it uses Docker to create containers. Settings: K3D offers a limited set of cluster settings as it does not support all the features that can be available in Kubernetes. If you need to use certain settings for your cluster, you will have to go to other tools or do your settings yourself. Low safety: K3D may be less safe than other tools such as Minikube or Kind, as it uses Docker containers that may have vulnerability that lead to a hacking of the system. Also, when using K3D, there may be problems with virtual networks that can be used to communicate between containers. Not all Kubernetes: K3D does not support all opportunities that can be available in Kubernetes because it is based on Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE). |

| **Name** | **Characteristics** | **Benefits** | **Minuses** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Docker | OS's: Docker supports many operating systems, including Linux, Windows and MacOS. Cross platform: Docker Containers can be launched on any Docker device. Easy use: Docker has a simple and understandable user interface that allows you to quickly create and run containers. Scale: Docker makes it easy to scalable containers, including automatic scaling and orchestration using tools such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. Libraries: Docker has a large number of libraries and tools that allow to expand its functionality. | Tolerance: Docker containers allow you to carry programs and their dependencies between different environments without compatibility problems. Speed: Docker containers can be running in a few seconds, allowing you to quickly deploy and test programs. Resource efficiency: Docker allows you to use devices more efficiently as containers are launched on one core of OS and use common infrastructure. | Safety Risks: Different vulnerability may be found in Docker that can be used by malefactors for a hacking of the container or isolation. Also, you should remember the possibility of infection with viruses or images. The complexity of the setup: Docker can be quite difficult to set up, especially when it comes to complex networks or various services. Large images: Docker images can be quite large, which can be a problem when loading and unfolding them. Resource Restrictions: Docker can use a considerable amount of resources such as memory and processor, which can be a problem for less powerful computers or servers. Licensing questions: Docker has a license that can be a limiting factor for some projects or companies. Dependence on repositories: Docker is commonly used with public repositories such as Docker Hub, which can make addiction to third-party services and their accessibility. |
| Podman | OS's: Linux, MacOS, Windows (through WSL2). Supported architecture: X86_64, ARM64 there is no need to install a docker demon that allows you to run containers in an isolated environment without the need to use the administrator's privileges. | Containers: The ability to use various tools to preserve images such as Local, Docker Hub, Quay.io, other registers. The ability to use: Dockerfile to create containers support for virtually all functions offering Docker cli availability Podman PS | Lower consumption of resources compared to docker launching containers in an isolated environment without the need to use the privileges of administrator support of different registers to preserve the insulting of OCI and Kubernetes Crusability of tools for monitoring and containers. Limited operating systems support requires some Windows-based training through WSL2 fewer docker tools, which can be a problem for some projects. |
---------------------------------------------

## Result

| **Choice between** | **What same** | **Why** |
|---|---|---|
| Docker and Podman | Docker | Because Docker can be used on many platforms and many arch's. For testing puropose is a best choice. |
| Minikube/Kind/k3d | Minikube | Depending on needs Comparing Minikube, Kind and K3D, you should pay attention to several factors. Minikube is quite simple to use, but it can be slightly slow because it starts on a local machine. Therefore, if you/we need a quick cluster, then minikube may not be the best choice. Kind is a convenient and easy-to-use way of running Kubernetes cluster, which also allows you to use your local machine. However, if you need a Kubernetes cluster with more resources, Kind can be less effective. k3d is another tool for running Kubernetes cluster that works in Docker and makes it easy to create clusters based on Docker. It is quite fast and efficient to use. So, if you are looking for a quick and easy-to-use tool that does not require much resources, k3d may be the best option. If you are looking for a test for testing or designing only, then Minikube and Kind can also be good options. Recommend k3d as universal choice for any purpose. |
